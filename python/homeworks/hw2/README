Steps to run the program

1. Run the command "make bayes", to start the naive-bayes classifier, which also generates some documents that k-nearest neighbors depends on
2. Run "make knn", which runs the k-nearest neighbors
3. Output of the program gives the document id(attribute "newid" in the sgm file) of the test document and the class predicted for it
4. Test document has to be placed in a directory and the directory path has to given in the config file

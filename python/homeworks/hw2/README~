Steps to run the program

1. Run the command "make bayes", to start the naive-bayes classifier, which also generates some documents that k-nearest neighbors depends on
2. Run "make knn", which runs the k-nearest neighbors
3. Output of the program gives the document id(attribute "newid" in the sgm file) of the test document and the class predicted for it
